Little Bird

Little bird, why so sad and blue?                                                                                                                                                           
Is it in your nature is that really you?                                                                                                                                                      
Did the World cut off your wings and tell you not to fly?                                                                                                                                   
Did everything thats good and warm Inside you fade and die?                                                                                                                                 
Oh little precious bird, fly fly fly
